## About Me

I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.ime.usp.br/en/dcc) of the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ime.usp.br/) of the [University of São Paulo](http://www.usp.br). My research mostly focuses on the computational aspects of discrete [probabilistic graphical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model) (e.g., [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network), [credal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credal_network), [sum-product networks](http://spn.cs.washington.edu/)) and their use in [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification), [robust inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprecise_probability) and planning under uncertainty. More recently, I became very enthusiastic about [probabilistic logic programming](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/) and its connection to neurosymbolic reasoning. My group is currently building a [neuro-symbolic reasoner supported by such techniques](https://kamel.ime.usp.br/dpasp). 

I am an Area Editor of the [International Journal of Approximate Reasoning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-approximate-reasoning), an Associate Editor of the [Artificial Intelligence Journal](https://aij.ijcai.org), and Senior Associate Editor of the new [ACM Transactions on Probabilistic Machine Learning Journal](https://dl.acm.org/journal/topml). I serve regularly in the Program Committee of top AI conferences (AAAI, IJCAI, UAI, etc). <!-- Between 2021 and 2024 I was part of the editorial board of the [Artificial Intelligence Journal](https://aij.ijcai.org). -->
