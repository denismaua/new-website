 abstract = {Many solutions to problems in machine learning and
artificial intelligence involve solving a combinatorial
optimization problem over discrete variables whose
functional dependence is conveniently represented by a
graph. This thesis addresses three types of these
combinatorial optimization problems, namely, the
maximum a posteriori inference in discrete
probabilistic graphical models, the selection of
optimal strategies for limited memory influence
diagrams, and the computation of upper and lower
probability bounds in credal networks. These three
problems arise out of seemingly very different
situations, and one might believe that they share no
more than the graph-based specification of their inputs
or the underlying probabilistic treatment of
uncertainty. However, correspondences among instances
of these problems have long been noticed in the
literature. For instance, the computation of
probability bounds in credal networks can be reduced
either to the problem of maximum a posteriori inference
in graphical models, or to the selection of optimal
strategies in limited memory influence diagrams.
Conversely, both the maximum a posteriori inference and
the strategy selection problems can be reduced to the
computation of a probability bound in a credal network.
These reductions suggest that much insight can be
gained by carrying out a joint study of the practical
and theoretical computational complexity of these three
problems. This thesis describes algorithms and
complexity results for these three classes of problems.
In particular, we develop a new anytime algorithm for
the maximum a posteriori problem. Not only the
algorithm is of practical relevance, as we show that it
compares favorably against a state-of-the-art method,
but it is the base of the proof of polynomial-time
approximability of the two other problems. We
characterize the tractability of the strategy selection
problem according to the input parameters, and we show
that the strategy selection problem can be solved in
polynomial time in singly connected diagrams over
binary variables and univariate utility functions, and
that relaxing any of these assumptions makes the
problem NP-hard to solve or even approximate within any
bound. We also investigate the theoretical complexity
of computing upper and lower probability bounds in
credal networks. We show that the complexity of the
problem depends on the irrelevance concept adopted, but
is in general NP-hard even in polytree-shaped networks,
and even in trees if we assume strong independence. We
also show that there is a particular type of inference
that can be solved in polynomial time in imprecise
hidden Markov models, whether we assume epistemic
irrelevance or strong independence.},
