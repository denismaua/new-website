abstract: Credal networks are graph-based statistical models whose parameters take
  values in a set, instead of being sharply specified as in traditional statistical
  models (e.g.,~Bayesian networks). The computational complexity of inferences on
  such models depends on the irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this paper,
  we study inferential complexity under the concepts of epistemic irrelevance and
  strong independence. We show that inferences under strong independence are NP-hard
  even in trees with ternary variables. We prove that under epistemic irrelevance
  the polynomial time complexity of inferences in credal trees is not likely to extend
  to more general models (e.g.~singly connected networks). These results clearly distinguish
  networks that admit efficient inferences and those where inferences are most likely
  hard, and settle several open questions regarding computational complexity.
