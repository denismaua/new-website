 abstract = {Credal networks are graph-based statistical models
whose parameters take values in a set, instead of being
sharply specified as in traditional statistical models
(e.g.,~Bayesian networks). The computational complexity
of inferences on such models depends on the
irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this
paper, we study inferential complexity under the
concepts of epistemic irrelevance and strong
independence. We show that inferences under strong
independence are NP-hard even in trees with ternary
variables. We prove that under epistemic irrelevance
the polynomial time complexity of inferences in credal
trees is not likely to extend to more general models
(e.g.~singly connected networks). These results clearly
distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences
and those where inferences are most likely hard, and
settle several open questions regarding computational
complexity.},
