abstract: We present dPASP, a novel declarative probabilistic logic programming framework
  that allows for the specification of discrete probabilistic models by neural predicates,
  relational logic constraints, and interval-valued probabilistic choices. This expressive
  combination facilitates the construction of models that combine low-level perception
  (images, texts, etc) and common-sense reasoning, thus providing an excellent tool
  for neurosymbolic reasoning. To support all such features, we discuss several semantics
  for probabilistic logic programs that allow one to express nondeterminism, non-monotonic
  reasoning, contradiction, and (vague) probabilistic knowledge. We also discuss how
  gradient-based learning can be performed with neural predicates and probabilistic
  choices under selected semantics. To showcase the possibilities offered by the framework,
  we present case studies that exploit different semantics and constructs.
