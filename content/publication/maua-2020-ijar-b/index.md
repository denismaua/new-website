abstract: Credal networks generalize Bayesian networks to allow for imprecision in
  probability values. This paper reviews the main results on credal networks under
  strong independence, as there has been significant progress in the literature during
  the last decade or so. We focus on computational aspects, summarizing the main algorithms
  and complexity results for inference and decision making. We address the question
  “What is really known about strong extensions of credal networks?” by looking at
  theoretical results and by presenting a short summary of real applications.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'We review 30 years of research in Bayesian networks with set-valued parameters.'
