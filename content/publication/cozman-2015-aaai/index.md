abstract: We examine the inferential complexity of Bayesian networks specified through
  logical constructs. We first consider simple propositional languages, and then move
  to relational languages. We examine both the combined complexity of inference (as
  network size and evidence size are not bounded) and the data complexity of inference
  (where network size is bounded); we also examine the connection to liftability through
  domain complexity. Combined and data complexity of several inference problems are
  presented, ranging from polynomial to exponential classes.
