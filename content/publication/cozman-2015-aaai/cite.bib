 abstract = {We examine the inferential complexity of Bayesian
networks specified through logical constructs. We first
consider simple propositional languages, and then move
to relational languages. We examine both the combined
complexity of inference (as network size and evidence
size are not bounded) and the data complexity of
inference (where network size is bounded); we also
examine the connection to liftability through domain
complexity. Combined and data complexity of several
inference problems are presented, ranging from
polynomial to exponential classes.},
