abstract: We present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision making problems
  represented as influence diagrams. We do not require the usual assumptions of no
  forgetting and regularity; this allows us to solve problems with simultaneous decisions
  and limited information. The algorithm is empirically shown to outperform a state-of-the-art
  algorithm on randomly generated problems of up to 150 variables and 10^64 solutions.
  We show that these problems are NP-hard even if the underlying graph structure of
  the problem has low treewidth and the variables take on a bounded number of states,
  and that they admit no provably good approximation if variables can take on an arbitrary
  number of states.
