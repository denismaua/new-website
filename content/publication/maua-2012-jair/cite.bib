 abstract = {We present a new algorithm for exactly solving
decision making problems represented as influence
diagrams. We do not require the usual assumptions of no
forgetting and regularity; this allows us to solve
problems with simultaneous decisions and limited
information. The algorithm is empirically shown to
outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm on randomly
generated problems of up to 150 variables and 10^64
solutions. We show that these problems are NP-hard even
if the underlying graph structure of the problem has
low treewidth and the variables take on a bounded
number of states, and that they admit no provably good
approximation if variables can take on an arbitrary
number of states.},
