abstract: Predictions made by imprecise-probability models are often indeterminate
  (that is, set-valued). Measuring the quality of an indeterminate prediction by a
  single number is important to fairly compare different models, but a principled
  approach to this problem is currently missing. In this paper we derive, from a set
  of assumptions, a metric to evaluate the predictions of credal classifiers. These
  are supervised learning models that issue set-valued predictions. The metric turns
  out to be made of an objective component, and another that is related to the decision-makerâ€™s
  degree of risk aversion to the variability of predictions. We discuss when the measure
  can be rendered independent of such a degree, and provide insights as to how the
  comparison of classifiers based on the new measure changes with the number of predictions
  to be made. Finally, we make extensive empirical tests of credal, as well as precise,
  classifiers by using the new metric. This shows the practical usefulness of the
  metric, while yielding a first insightful and extensive comparison of credal classifiers.
