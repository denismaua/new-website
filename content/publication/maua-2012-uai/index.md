abstract: Influence diagrams allow for intuitive and yet precise description of complex
  situations involving decision making under uncertainty. Unfortunately, most of the
  problems described by influence diagrams are hard to solve. In this paper we discuss
  the complexity of approximately solving influence diagrams. We do not assume no-forgetting
  or regularity, which makes the class of problems we address very broad. Remarkably,
  we show that when both the treewidth and the cardinality of the variables are bounded
  the problem admits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme.
