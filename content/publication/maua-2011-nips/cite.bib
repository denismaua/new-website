 abstract = {We present a new algorithm for exactly solving
decision-making problems represented as an influence
diagram. We do not require the usual assumptions of no
forgetting and regularity, which allows us to solve
problems with limited information. The algorithm, which
implements a sophisticated variable elimination
procedure, is empirically shown to outperform a
state-of-the-art algorithm in randomly generated
problems of up to 150 variables and $10^64$
strategies.},
