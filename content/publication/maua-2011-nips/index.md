abstract: We present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision-making problems
  represented as an influence diagram. We do not require the usual assumptions of
  no forgetting and regularity, which allows us to solve problems with limited information.
  The algorithm, which implements a sophisticated variable elimination procedure,
  is empirically shown to outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm in randomly generated
  problems of up to 150 variables and $10^64$ strategies.
