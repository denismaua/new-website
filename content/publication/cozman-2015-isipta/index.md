abstract: A credal network associates a directed acyclic graph with a collection of
  sets of probability measures. Usually these probability measures are specified through
  several tables containing probability values. Here we examine the complexity of
  inference in Boolean credal networks when probability measures are specified through
  formal languages, by extending a framework we have recently proposed for Bayesian
  networks. We show that sub-Boolean and relational logics lead to interesting complexity
  results. In short, we explore the relationship between language and complexity in
  credal networks.
