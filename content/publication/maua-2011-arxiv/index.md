abstract: We present a new algorithm for exactly solving decision making problems
  represented as influence diagrams. We do not require the usual assumptions of no
  forgetting and regularity; this allows us to solve problems with simultaneous decisions
  and limited information. The algorithm is empirically shown to outperform a state-of-the-art
  algorithm on randomly generated problems of up to 150 variables and $10^64$ solutions.
  We show that the problem is NP-hard even if the underlying graph structure of the
  problem has small treewidth and the variables take on a bounded number of states,
  but that a fully polynomial time approximation scheme exists for these cases. Moreover,
  we show that the bound on the number of states is a necessary condition for any
  efficient approximation scheme.
