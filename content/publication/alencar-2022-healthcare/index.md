abstract: 'Background: The decision to intubate COVID-19 patients receiving non-invasive
  respiratory support is challenging, requiring a fine balance between early intubation
  and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation versus the adverse effects of delaying
  intubation. This present study analyzes the association between intubation day and
  mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We performed a unicentric retrospective
  cohort study considering all COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted between March
  2020 and August 2020 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome
  was all-cause mortality within 28 days after intubation, and a Cox model was used
  to evaluate the effect of time from onset of symptoms to intubation in mortality.
  Results: A total of 592 (20%) patients of 3020 admitted with COVID-19 were intubated
  during study period, and 310 patients who were intubated deceased 28 days after
  intubation. Each additional day between the onset of symptoms and intubation was
  significantly associated with higher in-hospital death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.018;
  95% CI, 1.005&ndash;1.03). Conclusion: Among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who
  were intubated and mechanically ventilated, delaying intubation in the course of
  symptoms may be associated with higher mortality. Trial registration: The study
  protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (opinion number 3.990.817; CAAE:
  30417520.0.0000.0068).'
