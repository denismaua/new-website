abstract: In this paper we analyze the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning
  techniques in trust prediction. We use two propositionalization methods together
  with the Naive and Tree-Augmented Naive Bayesian Classifiers, and the C4.5 algorithm.
  We compare those results with classifiers defined through Markov Logic, using data
  fromthe Epinions.comwebsite, a well-known product review community. The experiments
  show that predicting trust relationships is a difficult task, in which Markov Logic
  models outperform other methods in accuracy but are able to recover only a relatively
  small fraction of the existing relationships in the dataset.
