abstract: A popular and effective approach for learning Bayesian network structures
  is to perform a greedy search on the space of variable orderings followed by an
  exhaustive search over the restricted space of compatible parent sets. Usually,
  the greedy search is initialized with a randomly sampled order. In this article
  we develop heuristics for producing informed initial solutions to order-based search
  motivated by the Feedback Arc Set Problem on data sets without missing values.
