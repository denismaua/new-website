abstract: We examine the complexity of inference in Bayesian networks specified by
  logical languages. We consider representations that range from fragments of propositional
  logic to function-free first-order logic with equality; in doing so we cover a variety
  of plate models and of probabilistic relational models. We study the complexity
  of inferences when network, query and domain are the input (the inferential and
  the combined complexity), when the network is fixed and query and domain are the
  input (the query/data complexity), and when the network and query are fixed and
  the domain is the input (the domain complexity). We draw connections with probabilistic
  databases and liftability results, and obtain complexity classes that range from
  polynomial to exponential levels; we identify new languages with tractable inference,
  and we relate our results to languages based on plates and probabilistic relational
  models.
