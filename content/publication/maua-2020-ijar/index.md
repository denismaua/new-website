abstract: We analyze the computational complexity of probabilistic logic programming
  with constraints, disjunctive heads, and aggregates such as sum and max. We consider
  propositional programs and relational programs with bounded-arity predicates, and
  look at cautious reasoning (i.e., computing the smallest probability of an atom
  over all probability models), cautious explanation (i.e., finding an interpretation
  that maximizes the lower probability of evidence) and cautious maximum-a-posteriori
  (i.e., finding a partial interpretation for a set of atoms that maximizes their
  lower probability conditional on evidence) under Lukasiewicz's credal semantics.
