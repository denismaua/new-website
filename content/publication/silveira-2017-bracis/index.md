abstract: In this paper, we propose using an University Entrance Exam (the Exame Nacional
  do Ensido Médio) as a proper test of success of artificial intelligence techniques,
  thus replacing the famous Turing Test. We argue that more importantly than measuring
  the ability of a system in replicating human competence, the so-called ENEM test
  can serve as a driver of development of new techniques. Additionally, we describe
  how we produced a machine-readable database of questions from previous exams, which
  can be used for comparing techniques for natural language processing, image processing
  and knowledge representation and reasoning. We then present some preliminaries to
  serve as baseline that are based on information retrieval techniques and Word2Vec.
  Experiments with previous exams show that in questions concerning Humanities and
  Languages these baseline methods perform in average slightly better than random
  guessing.
