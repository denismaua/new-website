abstract: Credal networks relax the precise probability requirement of Bayesian networks,
  enabling a richer representation of uncertainty in the form of closed convex sets
  of probability measures. The increase in expressiveness comes at the expense of
  higher computational costs. In this paper, we present a new variable elimination
  algorithm for exactly computing posterior inferences in extensively specified credal
  networks, which is empirically shown to outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm.
  The algorithm is then turned into a provably good approximation scheme, that is,
  a procedure that for any input is guaranteed to return a solution not worse than
  the optimum by a given factor. Remarkably, we show that when the networks have bounded
  treewidth and bounded number of states per variable the approximation algorithm
  runs in time polynomial in the input size and in the inverse of the error factor,
  thus being the first known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for inference
  in credal networks.
