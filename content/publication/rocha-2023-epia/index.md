abstract: The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked concerns
  about their potential to spread misinformation. As a result, there is a pressing
  need for tools to identify ``fake arguments'' generated by such models. To create
  these tools, examples of texts generated by LLMs are needed. This paper introduces
  a methodology to obtain good, bad and ugly arguments from argumentative essays produced
  by ChatGPT, OpenAI's LLM. We then describe a novel dataset containing a set of diverse
  arguments, ArGPT. We assess the effectiveness of our dataset and establish baselines
  for several argumentation-related tasks. Finally, we show that the artificially
  generated data relates well to human argumentation and thus is useful as a tool
  to train and test systems for the defined tasks.
