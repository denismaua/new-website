abstract: We examine the meaning and the complexity of probabilistic logic programs
  that consist of a set of rules and a set of independent probabilistic facts (that
  is, programs based on Sato's distribution semantics). We focus on two semantics,
  respectively based on stable and on well-founded models. We show that the semantics
  based on stable models (referred to as the \"credal semantics\") produces sets of
  probability measures that dominate infinitely monotone Choquet capacities; we describe
  several useful consequences of this result. We then examine the complexity of inference
  with probabilistic logic programs. We distinguish between the complexity of inference
  when a probabilistic program and a query are given (the inferential complexity),
  and the complexity of inference when the probabilistic program is fixed and the
  query is given (the query complexity, akin to data complexity as used in database
  theory). We obtain results on the inferential and query complexity for acyclic,
  stratified, and normal propositional and relational programs; complexity reaches
  various levels of the counting hierarchy and even exponential levels.
