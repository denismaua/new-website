abstract: Probabilistic Answer Set Programming (PASP) combines rules, facts, and independent
  probabilistic facts. We argue that a very useful modeling paradigm is obtained by
  adopting a particular semantics for PASP, where one associates a credal set with
  each consistent program. We examine the basic properties of PASP under this credal
  semantics, in particular presenting novel results on its complexity and its expressivity,
  and we introduce an inference algorithm to compute (upper) probabilities given a
  program.
