abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used models for sequential data.
  As with other probabilistic models, they require the specification of local conditional
  probability distributions, which can be too difficult and error-prone, especially
  when data are scarce or costly to acquire. The imprecise HMM (iHMM) generalizes
  HMMs by allowing the quantification to be done by sets of, instead of single, probability
  distributions. iHMMs have the ability to suspend judgment when there is not enough
  statistical evidence, and can serve as a sensitivity analysis tool for standard
  non-stationary HMMs. In this paper, we formalize iHMMs and develop efficient inference
  algorithms to address standard HMM usage such as the computation of likelihoods
  and most probable explanations. Experiments with real data show that iHMMs produce
  more reliable inferences without compromising efficiency.
