 abstract = {Two important tasks in probabilistic reasoning are the
computation of the maximum posterior probability of a
given subset of the variables in a Bayesian network
(MAP), and the computation of the maximum expected
utility of a strategy in an influence diagram (MEU).
Despite their similarities, research on both problems
have largely been conducted independently, with
algorithmic solutions and insights designed for one
problem not (trivially) transferable to the other one.
In this work, we show constructively that these two
problems are equivalent in the sense that any algorithm
designed for one problem can be used to solve the other
with small overhead. These equivalences extend the
toolbox of either problem, and shall foster new
insights into their solution.},
