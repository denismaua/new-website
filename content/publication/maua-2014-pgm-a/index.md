abstract: Two important tasks in probabilistic reasoning are the computation of the
  maximum posterior probability of a given subset of the variables in a Bayesian network
  (MAP), and the computation of the maximum expected utility of a strategy in an influence
  diagram (MEU). Despite their similarities, research on both problems have largely
  been conducted independently, with algorithmic solutions and insights designed for
  one problem not (trivially) transferable to the other one. In this work, we show
  constructively that these two problems are equivalent in the sense that any algorithm
  designed for one problem can be used to solve the other with small overhead. These
  equivalences extend the toolbox of either problem, and shall foster new insights
  into their solution.
