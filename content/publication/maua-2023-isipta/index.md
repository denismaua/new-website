abstract: Probabilistic Answer Set Programming offers an intuitive and powerful declarative
  language to represent uncertainty about combinatorial structures. Remarkably, under
  the credal semantics, such programs can specify any infinitely monotone Choquet
  Capacity in an intuitive way. Yet, one might be interested in specifying more general
  credal sets. We examine how probabilistic answer set programs can be extended to
  represent more general credal sets with constructs that allow for imprecise probability
  values. We characterize the credal sets that can be captured with various languages,
  and discuss the expressivity and complexity added by the use of imprecision in probabilistic
  constructs.
