abstract: We present a novel approach for multilabel classification based on an ensemble
  of Bayesian networks. The class variables are connected by a tree; each model of
  the ensemble uses a different class as root of the tree. We assume the features
  to be conditionally independent given the classes, thus generalizing the naive Bayes
  assumption to the multiclass case. This assumption allows us to optimally identify
  the correlations between classes and features; such correlations are moreover shared
  across all models of the ensemble. Inferences are drawn from the ensemble via logarithmic
  opinion pooling. To minimize Hamming loss, we compute the marginal probability of
  the classes by running standard inference on each Bayesian network in the ensemble,
  and then pooling the inferences. To instead minimize the subset 0/1 loss, we pool
  the joint distributions of each model and cast the problem as a MAP inference in
  the corresponding graphical model. Experiments show that the approach is competitive
  with state-of-the-art methods for multilabel classification.
