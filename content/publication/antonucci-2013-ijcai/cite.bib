 abstract = {We present a novel approach for multilabel
classification based on an ensemble of Bayesian
networks. The class variables are connected by a tree;
each model of the ensemble uses a different class as
root of the tree. We assume the features to be
conditionally independent given the classes, thus
generalizing the naive Bayes assumption to the
multiclass case. This assumption allows us to optimally
identify the correlations between classes and features;
such correlations are moreover shared across all models
of the ensemble. Inferences are drawn from the ensemble
via logarithmic opinion pooling. To minimize Hamming
loss, we compute the marginal probability of the
classes by running standard inference on each Bayesian
network in the ensemble, and then pooling the
inferences. To instead minimize the subset 0/1 loss, we
pool the joint distributions of each model and cast the
problem as a MAP inference in the corresponding
graphical model. Experiments show that the approach is
competitive with state-of-the-art methods for
multilabel classification.},
