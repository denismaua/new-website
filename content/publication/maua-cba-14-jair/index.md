abstract: Credal networks are graph-based statistical models whose parameters take
  values in a set, instead of being sharply specified as in traditional statistical
  models (e.g., Bayesian networks). The computational complexity of inferences on
  such models depends on the irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this paper,
  we study inferential complexity under the concepts of epistemic irrelevance and
  strong independence. We show that inferences under strong independence are NP-hard
  even in trees with binary variables except for a single ternary one. We prove that
  under epistemic irrelevance the polynomial-time complexity of inferences in credal
  trees is not likely to extend to more general models (e.g., singly connected topologies).
  These results clearly distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences and those
  where inferences are most likely hard, and settle several open questions regarding
  their computational complexity. We show that these results remain valid even if
  we disallow the use of zero probabilities. We also show that the computation of
  bounds on the probability of the future state in a hidden Markov model is the same
  whether we assume epistemic irrelevance or strong independence, and we prove a similar
  result for inference in naive Bayes structures. These inferential equivalences are
  important for practitioners, as hidden Markov models and naive Bayes structures
  are used in real applications of imprecise probability.
