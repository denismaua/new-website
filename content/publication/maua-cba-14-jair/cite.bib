 abstract = {Credal networks are graph-based statistical models
whose parameters take values in a set, instead of being
sharply specified as in traditional statistical models
(e.g., Bayesian networks). The computational complexity
of inferences on such models depends on the
irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this
paper, we study inferential complexity under the
concepts of epistemic irrelevance and strong
independence. We show that inferences under strong
independence are NP-hard even in trees with binary
variables except for a single ternary one. We prove
that under epistemic irrelevance the polynomial-time
complexity of inferences in credal trees is not likely
to extend to more general models (e.g., singly
connected topologies). These results clearly
distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences
and those where inferences are most likely hard, and
settle several open questions regarding their
computational complexity. We show that these results
remain valid even if we disallow the use of zero
probabilities. We also show that the computation of
bounds on the probability of the future state in a
hidden Markov model is the same whether we assume
epistemic irrelevance or strong independence, and we
prove a similar result for inference in naive Bayes
structures. These inferential equivalences are
important for practitioners, as hidden Markov models
and naive Bayes structures are used in real
applications of imprecise probability.},
