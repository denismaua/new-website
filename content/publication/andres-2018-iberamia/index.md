abstract: 'In many realistic planning situations, any policy has a non-zero probability
  of reaching a dead-end. In such cases, a popular approach is to plan to maximize
  the probability of reaching the goal. While this strategy increases the robustness
  and expected autonomy of the robot, it considers that the robot gives up on the
  task whenever a dead-end is encountered. In this work, we consider planning for
  agents that pro-actively and autonomously resort to human help when an unavoidable
  dead-end is encountered (the so-called symbiotic agents). To this end, we develop
  a new class of Goal-Oriented Markov Decision Process that includes a set of human
  actions that ensures the existence of a proper policy, one that possibly resorts
  to human help. We discuss two different optimization criteria: minimizing the probability
  to use human help and minimizing the expected cumulative cost with a finite penalty
  for using human help for the first time. We show that for a large enough penalty
  both criteria are equivalent. We report on experiments with standard probabilistic
  planning domains for reasonably large problems.'
