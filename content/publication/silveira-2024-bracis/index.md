abstract: Automatic Essay Scoring promises to scale up student feedback on written
  input, addressing the excessive cost and time demand associated with human grading.
  State-of-the-art automatic scorers are based on Transformers-based neural networks.
  While such models have shown impressive results in reasoning tasks, learned models
  often produce answers that arise from statistical clues in datasets and are misaligned
  with human objectives. Such systems are thus potentially fragile for scenarios where
  users are incentivized to deceive the system, as in a classroom setting. In this
  work, we evaluate the susceptibility of state-of-the-art automatic scorers to attacks
  made by non-expert users, such as students interacting with an automatic grader.
  We develop a methodology to simulate such student attacks and test them against
  scorers based on BERT, Phi-3 and Gemini models. Our findings suggest that (i) a
  BERT-based grader can be deceived using simple feature-based attacks; (ii) although
  Google's Gemini has a solid agreement with graders, it can assign undeservedly high
  grades for small sentences; (iii) a Phi-3-based grader was less susceptible than
  BERT, but it still assigned relatively high grades to some of our attacks.
