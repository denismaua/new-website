abstract: 'This paper describes advances in the development of a trust management
  system for web-based virtual communities. We review current research on computational
  trust and report on a proposal for trust management with Markov Logic, a recently
  developed probabilistic logic language that aims at unifying statistical relational
  procedures. This work addresses two complex questions: how to learn trust metrics
  for a group of interacting agents upon amachine learning perspective, and how to
  use pairwise trust metrics structured as a trust network to compute personalized
  trust metrics.'
