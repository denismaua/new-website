abstract: Credal networks lift the precise probability assumption of Bayesian networks,
  enabling a richer representation of uncertainty in the form of closed convex sets
  of probability measures. The increase in expressiveness comes at the expense of
  higher computational costs. In this paper we present a new algorithm which is an
  extension of the well-known variable elimination algorithm for computing posterior
  inferences in extensively specified credal networks. The algorithm efficiency is
  empirically shown to outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm. We then provide the
  first fully polynomial time approximation scheme for inference in credal networks
  with bounded treewidth and number of states per variable.
