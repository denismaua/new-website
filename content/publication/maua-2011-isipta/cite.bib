 abstract = {Credal networks lift the precise probability
assumption of Bayesian networks, enabling a richer
representation of uncertainty in the form of closed
convex sets of probability measures. The increase in
expressiveness comes at the expense of higher
computational costs. In this paper we present a new
algorithm which is an extension of the well-known
variable elimination algorithm for computing posterior
inferences in extensively specified credal networks.
The algorithm efficiency is empirically shown to
outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm. We then
provide the first fully polynomial time approximation
scheme for inference in credal networks with bounded
treewidth and number of states per variable.},
