abstract: We examine the consequences of directed cycles in graph-based representations
  of joint distributions, investigating the effect of cycles on Markov conditions
  and on Gibbs factorizations. We focus on Logical Credal Networks, a flexible and
  general formalism, showing that Kosterâ€™s theory of Directed-Undirected Mixed Graphs
  (DUMGs) leads to an interesting Gibbs factorization. We show that inferences with
  DUMGs lead to multilinear programs. We also study the failure of global Markov conditions
  in cyclic structural equation models, connecting that failure to probabilistic imprecision
  under interventions.
