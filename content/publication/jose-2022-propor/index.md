abstract: Deep learning transformers have drastically improved systems that automatically
  answer questions in natural language. However, different questions demand different
  answering techniques; here we propose, build and validate an architecture that integrates
  different modules to answer two distinct kinds of queries. Our architecture takes
  a free-form natural language text and classifies it to send it either to a Neural
  Question Answering Reasoner or a Natural Language parser to SQL. We implemented
  a complete system for the Portuguese language, using some of the main tools available
  for the language and translating training and testing datasets. Experiments show
  that our system selects the appropriate answering method with high accuracy (over
  99%), thus validating a modular question answering strategy.
