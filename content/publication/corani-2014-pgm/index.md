abstract: In previous work, we devised an approach for multilabel classification based
  on an ensemble of Bayesian networks. It was characterized by an efficient structural
  learning and by high accuracy. Its shortcoming was the high computational complexity
  of the MAP inference, necessary to identify the most probable joint configuration
  of all classes. In this work, we switch from the ensemble approach to the single
  model approach. This allows important computational savings. The reduction of inference
  times is exponential in the difference between the treewidth of the single model
  and the number of classes. We adopt moreover a more sophisticated approach for the
  structural learning of the class subgraph. The proposed single models outperforms
  alternative approaches for multilabel classification such as binary relevance and
  ensemble of classifier chains.
