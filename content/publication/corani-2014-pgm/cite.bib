 abstract = {In previous work, we devised an approach for
multilabel classification based on an ensemble of
Bayesian networks. It was characterized by an efficient
structural learning and by high accuracy. Its
shortcoming was the high computational complexity of
the MAP inference, necessary to identify the most
probable joint configuration of all classes. In this
work, we switch from the ensemble approach to the
single model approach. This allows important
computational savings. The reduction of inference times
is exponential in the difference between the treewidth
of the single model and the number of classes. We adopt
moreover a more sophisticated approach for the
structural learning of the class subgraph. The proposed
single models outperforms alternative approaches for
multilabel classification such as binary relevance and
ensemble of classifier chains.},
