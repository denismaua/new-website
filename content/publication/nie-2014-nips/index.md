abstract: This work presents novel algorithms for learning Bayesian networks of bounded
  treewidth. Both exact and approximate methods are developed. The exact method combines
  mixed integer linear programming formulations for structure learning and treewidth
  computation. The approximate method consists in sampling k-trees (maximal graphs
  of treewidth k), and subsequently selecting, exactly or approximately, the best
  structure whose moral graph is a subgraph of that k-tree. The approaches are empirically
  compared to each other and to state-of-the-art methods on a collection of public
  data sets with up to 100 variables.
