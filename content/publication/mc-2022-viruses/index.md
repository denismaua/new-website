abstract: 'Identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal
  swab sample is a common test for diagnosing COVID-19. However, some patients present
  clinical, laboratorial, and radiological evidence of COVID-19 infection with negative
  RT-PCR result(s). Thus, we assessed whether positive results were associated with
  intubation and mortality. This study was conducted in a Brazilian tertiary hospital
  from March to August of 2020. All patients had clinical, laboratory, and radiological
  diagnosis of COVID-19. They were divided into two groups: positive (+) RT-PCR group,
  with 2292 participants, and negative (&minus;) RT-PCR group, with 706 participants.
  Patients with negative RT-PCR testing and an alternative most probable diagnosis
  were excluded from the study. The RT-PCR(+) group presented increased risk of intensive
  care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and
  28-day mortality, when compared to the RT-PCR(&minus;) group. A positive SARS-CoV-2
  RT-PCR result was independently associated with intubation and 28 day in-hospital
  mortality. Accordingly, we concluded that patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis based
  on clinical data, despite a negative RT-PCR test from nasopharyngeal samples, presented
  more favorable outcomes than patients with positive RT-PCR test(s).'
