 abstract = {Probabilistic logic programming extends logic programming to offer a rich specification language for statistical relational models and,
more recently, to neurosymbolic reasoners. The standard stable model semantics adopted by probabilistic logic programs collapses in the
presence of contradictions that can arise when knowledge is not carefully elicited. In this work, we study probabilistic disjunctive logic
programs under the least-undefined stable model semantics. We prove missing complexity results for logic inference with bounded-arity
predicates, and then derive the complexity of probabilistic inference with respect to both the credal and the maximum entropy semantics.},
