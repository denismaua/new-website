abstract: Probabilistic logic programming extends logic programming to offer a rich
  specification language for statistical relational models and, more recently, to
  neurosymbolic reasoners. The standard stable model semantics adopted by probabilistic
  logic programs collapses in the presence of contradictions that can arise when knowledge
  is not carefully elicited. In this work, we study probabilistic disjunctive logic
  programs under the least-undefined stable model semantics. We prove missing complexity
  results for logic inference with bounded-arity predicates, and then derive the complexity
  of probabilistic inference with respect to both the credal and the maximum entropy
  semantics.
