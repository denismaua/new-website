abstract: There is a large number of user reviews on the internet with valuable information
  on services, products, politics and trends. There is both scientific and economic
  interest in the automatic understanding of such data. Sentiment classification is
  concerned with automatic extraction of opinions expressed in user reviews. Unlike
  standard text categorization tasks that deal with the classification of documents
  into subjects such as sports, economics and tourism, sentiment classification attempts
  to tag documents with respect to the feelings they express. Compared to the accuracy
  of standard methods, sentiment classifiers have shown poor performance. One possible
  cause of such a poor performance is the lack of adequate representations that lead
  to opinion discrimination in a concise and machine-readable form. Topic Models are
  statistical models concerned with the extraction of semantic information hidden
  in the large number of data available in text collections. They represent a document
  as a mixture of topics, probability distributions over words that represent a semantic
  concept. According to Topic Model representation, words can be substituted by topics
  able to represent concisely its meaning. Indeed, Topic Models perform a data dimensionality
  reduction that can improve the performance of text classification and information
  retrieval techniques. In sentiment classification, they can provide the necessary
  representation by extracting topics that represent the general feelings expressed
  in text. This work presents a study of the use of Topic Models for representing
  and classifying user reviews with respect to their feelings. In particular, the
  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and four extensions (two of them developed
  by the author) are evaluated on the task of aspect-based sentiment classification.
  The extensions to the LDA model enables us to investigate the effects of the incorporation
  of additional information such as context, aspect rating and multiple aspect rating
  into the original model.
