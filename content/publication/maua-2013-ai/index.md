abstract: Influence diagrams are intuitive and concise representations of structured
  decision problems. When the problem is non-Markovian, an optimal strategy can be
  exponentially large in the size of the diagram. We can avoid the inherent intractability
  by constraining the size of admissible strategies, giving rise to limited memory
  influence diagrams. A valuable question is then how small do strategies need to
  be to enable efficient optimal planning. Arguably, the smallest strategies one can
  conceive simply prescribe an action for each time step, without considering past
  decisions or observations. Previous work has shown that finding such optimal strategies
  even for polytree-shaped diagrams with ternary variables and a single value node
  is NP-hard, but the case of binary variables was left open. In this paper we address
  such a case, by first noting that optimal strategies can be obtained in polynomial
  time for polytree-shaped diagrams with binary variables and a single value node.
  We then show that the same problem is NP-hard if the diagram has multiple value
  nodes. These two results close the fixed-parameter complexity analysis of optimal
  strategy selection in influence diagrams parametrized by the shape of the diagram,
  the number of value nodes and the maximum variable cardinality.
