abstract: 'This paper describes a real application of graphical neural networks (GNNs) in the dynamic estimation of spatially distributed buoys that are of central importance in maritime navigation. We describe the techniques we used to process both data and background knowledge about the domain, indicating why GNNs are particularly well suited for this sort of task. We report our empirical results, demonstrating that GNNs profitably use the available relational structure.'
