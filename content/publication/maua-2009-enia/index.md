abstract: A large number of user reviews in the internet contains valuable information
  on services and products; for this reason, there is interest in automatically understanding
  such reviews. Sentiment Classification labels documents according to the feelings
  they express; instead of classifying a document into topics (sports, economics,
  etc), one attempts to tag the document according to overall feelings. Compared to
  the accuracy of traditional text categorization methods, sentiment classifiers have
  shown poor performance. We argue that such bad results are due to an improper representation
  of reviews. We describe a weakly supervisedmethod that converts raw text into an
  appropriate represen- tation, and show how techniques from information retrieval
  can acquire labeled data and process data using Markov logic. We report results
  on sentence classification and rating prediction that support our claims.
