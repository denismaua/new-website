  abstract = {Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operations to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries---including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment---correspond to a combination of basic operations over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operations, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.}

    abstract = {We present dPASP, a novel declarative probabilistic logic programming framework that allows for the specification of discrete probabilistic models by neural predicates, relational logic constraints, and interval-valued probabilistic choices. This expressive combination facilitates the construction of models that combine low-level perception (images, texts, etc) and common-sense reasoning, thus providing an excellent tool for neurosymbolic reasoning. To support all such features, we discuss several semantics for probabilistic logic programs that allow one to express nondeterminism, non-monotonic reasoning, contradiction, and (vague) probabilistic knowledge. We also discuss how gradient-based learning can be performed with neural predicates and probabilistic choices under selected semantics. To showcase the possibilities offered by the framework, we present case studies that exploit different semantics and constructs.}

abstract="Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agents use data collected by exploration of the environment to produce a model of the dynamics, which is then used to select a policy that maximizes the objective function. Stochastic Value Gradient (SVG) methods perform the latter step by optimizing some estimate of the value function gradient. Despite showing promising empirical results, many implementations of SVG methods lack rigorous theoretical or empirical justification; this casts doubts as to whether good performance are in large part due to the benchmark-overfitting. To better understand the advantages and shortcomings of existing SVG methods, in this work we carry out a fine-grained empirical analysis of three core components of SVG-based agents: (i) the gradient estimator formula, (ii) the model learning and (iii) the value function approximation. To this end, we extend previous work that proposes using Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator problems to benchmark SVG methods. LQG problems are heavily studied in optimal control literature and deliver challenging learning settings while still allowing comparison with ground-truth values. We use such problems to investigate the contribution of each core component of SVG methods to the overall performance. We focus our analysis on the model learning component, which was neglected from previous work, and we show that overfitting to on-policy data can lead to accurate state predictions but inaccurate gradients, highlighting the importance of exploration also in model-based methods.",

abstract="As time passes by, the performance of real-world predictive models degrades due to distributional shifts and learned spurious correlations. Typical countermeasures, such as retraining and online learning, can be costly and challenging in production, especially when accounting for business constraints and culture.  Causality-based approaches aim to identify invariant mechanisms from data, thus leading to more robust predictors at the possible expense of decreasing short-term performance. However, most such approaches scale poorly to high dimensions or require extra knowledge such as data segmentation in representative environments.  In this work, we develop the Time Robust Trees, a new algorithm for inducing decision trees with an inductive bias towards learning time-invariant rules. The algorithm's main innovation is to replace the usual information-gain split criterion (or similar) with a new criterion that examines the imbalance among classes induced by the split through time. Experiments with real data show that our approach improves long-term generalization, thus offering an exciting alternative for classification problems under distributional shift.",

ABSTRACT = {Background: The decision to intubate COVID-19 patients receiving non-invasive respiratory support is challenging, requiring a fine balance between early intubation and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation versus the adverse effects of delaying intubation. This present study analyzes the association between intubation day and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We performed a unicentric retrospective cohort study considering all COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted between March 2020 and August 2020 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days after intubation, and a Cox model was used to evaluate the effect of time from onset of symptoms to intubation in mortality. Results: A total of 592 (20%) patients of 3020 admitted with COVID-19 were intubated during study period, and 310 patients who were intubated deceased 28 days after intubation. Each additional day between the onset of symptoms and intubation was significantly associated with higher in-hospital death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.018; 95% CI, 1.005&ndash;1.03). Conclusion: Among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were intubated and mechanically ventilated, delaying intubation in the course of symptoms may be associated with higher mortality. Trial registration: The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (opinion number 3.990.817; CAAE: 30417520.0.0000.0068).},

ABSTRACT = {Identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample is a common test for diagnosing COVID-19. However, some patients present clinical, laboratorial, and radiological evidence of COVID-19 infection with negative RT-PCR result(s). Thus, we assessed whether positive results were associated with intubation and mortality. This study was conducted in a Brazilian tertiary hospital from March to August of 2020. All patients had clinical, laboratory, and radiological diagnosis of COVID-19. They were divided into two groups: positive (+) RT-PCR group, with 2292 participants, and negative (&minus;) RT-PCR group, with 706 participants. Patients with negative RT-PCR testing and an alternative most probable diagnosis were excluded from the study. The RT-PCR(+) group presented increased risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and 28-day mortality, when compared to the RT-PCR(&minus;) group. A positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was independently associated with intubation and 28 day in-hospital mortality. Accordingly, we concluded that patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis based on clinical data, despite a negative RT-PCR test from nasopharyngeal samples, presented more favorable outcomes than patients with positive RT-PCR test(s).},

Such task falls under the umbrella of Risk-Sensitive Markov Decision Processes, which optimize a non-additive, non-linear function of cumulative cost that incorporates the user's attitude towards risk. Current algorithms for solving that task, for any budget equal or smaller than an user-defined budget, scale poorly when the support of the cost function is large, since they operate in an augmented state space which enumerates all possible remaining budgets. To circumvent this issue, we develop (i) an improved version of the Topological Value Iteration with Dynamic Programming algorithm (tvi-dp), and (ii) the first symbolic dynamic programming algorithm for this class of problems, called rs-spudd, that exploits conditional independence in the transition function in the augmented state space. The proposed algorithms improve efficiency by pruning irrelevant states and terminating early, without sacrificing optimality. Empirical results show that rs-spudd is able to solve problems up to 103 times larger than tvi-dp.}

Despite some promising recent advances in the topic, very little attention has been given to the problem of effectively learning PSDDs from data and logical constraints in large domains. In this paper, we show that a simple strategy of sampling and averaging PSDDs leads to state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. We overcome some of the issues with previous methods by employing a top-down generation of circuits from a logic formula represented as a BDD. We discuss how to locally grow the circuit while achieving a good trade-off between complexity and goodness-of-fit of the resulting model. Generalization error is further decreased by aggregating sampled circuits through an ensemble of models. Experiments with various domains show that the approach efficiently learns good models even in very low data regimes, while remaining competitive for large sample sizes.},

Recently, a technique called Planning through Backpropagation (PtB) was introduced as an efficient and scalable alternative to traditional optimization-based methods for continuous planning problems. PtB leverages modern gradient descent algorithms and highly optimized automatic differentiation libraries to obtain approximate solutions. However, to date there have been no empirical evaluations comparing PtB with Linear-Quadratic (LQ) control problems. In this work, we compare PtB with an optimal algorithm from control theory called LQR, and its iterative version iLQR, when solving linear and non-linear continuous deterministic planning problems. The empirical results suggest that PtB can be an efficient alternative to optimizing non-linear continuous deterministic planning, being much easier to be implemented and stabilized than classical model-predictive control methods.},

In goal-driven problems, modeled as Shortest Stochastic Path (ssp) problems, risk arises from the uncertainties on future events and how they can lead to goal states. An ssp agent that minimizes the expected accumulated cost is considered a risk-neutral agent, while with a different optimization criterion it could choose between two extreme attitudes: risk-aversion or risk-prone. In this work we consider a Risk Sensitive ssp (called rs-ssp) that uses an expected exponential utility parameterized by the risk factor \$\$\backslashlambda \$\$that is used to define the agent's risk attitude. Moreover, a \$\$\backslashlambda \$\$-value is feasible if it admits a policy with finite expected cost. There are several algorithms capable of determining an optimal policy for rs-ssp s when we fix a feasible value for \$\$\backslashlambda \$\$. However, so far, there has been only one approach to find an extreme \$\$\backslashlambda \$\$feasible i.e., an extreme risk-averse policy. In this work we propose and compare new approaches to finding the extreme feasible \$\$\backslashlambda \$\$value for a given rs-ssp, and to return the corresponding extreme risk-averse policy. Experiments on three benchmark domains show that our proposals outperform previous approach, allowing the solution of larger problems.},

As with many other probabilistic models, performing Maximum-A-Posteriori inference in SPNs is NP-hard. Selective SPNs are a subclass of SPNs that allow for efficient Maximum-A-Posteriori inference and closed-form parameter learning. Due to the high number of parameters, SPNs learned from data can produce unreliable and overconfident inferences, especially for instances with low statistical support. This issue can be partially mitigated by performing a robustness analysis of inferences with respect to small changes in the parameters. In this work, we address the problem of assessing the robustness of Maximum-A-Posteriori inferences produced with Selective SPNs to global perturbations of the parameters. We consider such an inference robust if it remains the single maximizer under small perturbations of the model parameters. We present efficient algorithms and an empirical analysis with realistic problems involving missing data completion and multilabel classification. The experiments show that our criteria are informative with respect to the inference accuracy, suggesting that it indeed discriminate robust and non-robust instances.}

abstract = "Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are logic circuits where the inputs of disjunctive gates are annotated by probability values. They allow for a compact representation of joint probability mass functions defined over sets of Boolean variables, that are also consistent with the logical constraints defined by the circuit. The probabilities in such a model are usually “learned” from a set of observations. This leads to overconfident and prior-dependent inferences when data are scarce, unreliable or conflicting. In this work, we develop the credal sentential decision diagrams, a generalisation of their probabilistic counterpart that allows for replacing the local probabilities with (so-called credal) sets of mass functions. These models induce a joint credal set over the set of Boolean variables, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the logical constraints. Three inference algorithms are derived for these models. These allow to compute: (i) the lower and upper probabilities of an observation for an arbitrary number of variables; (ii) the lower and upper conditional probabilities for the state of a single variable given an observation; (iii) whether or not all the probabilistic sentential decision diagrams compatible with the credal specification have the same most probable explanation of a given set of variables given an observation of the other variables. These inferences are tractable, as all the three algorithms, based on bottom-up traversal with local linear programming tasks on the disjunctive gates, can be solved in polynomial time with respect to the circuit size. The first algorithm is always exact, while the remaining two might induce a conservative (outer) approximation in the case of multiply connected circuits. A semantics for this approximation together with an auxiliary algorithm able to decide whether or not the result is exact is also provided together with a brute-force characterization of the exact inference in these cases. For a first empirical validation, we consider a simple application based on noisy seven-segment display images. The credal models are observed to properly distinguish between easy and hard-to-detect instances and outperform other generative models not able to cope with logical constraints."

  abstract = {In many realistic planning situations, any policy has a non-zero probability of reaching a dead-end. In such cases, a popular approach is to plan to maximize the probability of reaching the goal. While this strategy increases the robustness and expected autonomy of the robot, it considers that the robot gives up on the task whenever a dead-end is encountered. In this work, we consider planning for agents that pro-actively and autonomously resort to human help when an unavoidable dead-end is encountered (the so-called symbiotic agents). To this end, we develop a new class of Goal-Oriented Markov Decision Process that includes a set of human actions that ensures the existence of a proper policy, one that possibly resorts to human help. We discuss two different optimization criteria: minimizing the probability to use human help and minimizing the expected cumulative cost with a finite penalty for using human help for the first time. We show that for a large enough penalty both criteria are equivalent. We report on experiments with standard probabilistic planning domains for reasonably large problems.}

Sum-Product Networks (SPN) are deep probabilistic models that have shown promising results in many tasks. As with many other probabilistic models, performing Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference is NP-hard in SPNs. In this work we investigate the use of SPNs for Multi-Label classification.

Additionally, we describe how we produced a machine-readable database of questions from previous exams, which can be used for comparing techniques for natural language processing, image processing and knowledge representation and reasoning. We then present some preliminaries to serve as baseline that are based on information retrieval techniques and Word2Vec. Experiments with previous exams show that in questions concerning Humanities and Languages these baseline methods perform in average slightly better than random guessing.}

We distinguish between the complexity of inference when a probabilistic program and a query are given (the inferential complexity), and the complexity of inference when the probabilistic program is fixed and the query is given (the query complexity, akin to data complexity as used in database theory).

We study the complexity of inferences when network, query and domain are the input (the inferential and the combined complexity), when the network is fixed and query and domain are the input (the query/data complexity), and when the network and query are fixed and the domain is the input (the domain complexity). We draw connections with probabilistic databases and liftability results, and obtain complexity classes that range from polynomial to exponential levels.},

  abstract =     "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used models for
                 sequential data. As with other probabilistic models,
                 they require the specification of local conditional
                 probability distributions, which can be too difficult
                 and error-prone, especially when data are scarce or
                 costly to acquire. The imprecise HMM (iHMM) generalizes
                 HMMs by allowing the quantification to be done by sets
                 of, instead of single, probability distributions. iHMMs
                 have the ability to suspend judgment when there is not
                 enough statistical evidence, and can serve as a
                 sensitivity analysis tool for standard non-stationary
                 HMMs. In this paper, we formalize iHMMs and develop
                 efficient inference algorithms to address standard HMM
                 usage such as the computation of likelihoods and most
                 probable explanations. Experiments with real data show

                 compromising efficiency.",

                 whose parameters take values in a set, instead of being
                 sharply specified as in traditional statistical models
                 (e.g., Bayesian networks). The computational complexity
                 of inferences on such models depends on the
                 irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this
                 paper, we study inferential complexity under the
                 concepts of epistemic irrelevance and strong
                 independence. We show that inferences under strong
                 independence are NP-hard even in trees with binary
                 variables except for a single ternary one. We prove
                 that under epistemic irrelevance the polynomial-time
                 complexity of inferences in credal trees is not likely
                 to extend to more general models (e.g., singly
                 connected topologies). These results clearly
                 distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences
                 and those where inferences are most likely hard, and
                 settle several open questions regarding their
                 computational complexity. We show that these results
                 remain valid even if we disallow the use of zero
                 probabilities. We also show that the computation of
                 bounds on the probability of the future state in a
                 hidden Markov model is the same whether we assume
                 epistemic irrelevance or strong independence, and we
                 prove a similar result for inference in naive Bayes
                 structures. These inferential equivalences are
                 important for practitioners, as hidden Markov models

  abstract =     "Influence diagrams are intuitive and concise
                 representations of structured decision problems. When
                 the problem is non-Markovian, an optimal strategy can
                 be exponentially large in the size of the diagram. We
                 can avoid the inherent intractability by constraining
                 the size of admissible strategies, giving rise to
                 limited memory influence diagrams. A valuable question
                 is then how small do strategies need to be to enable
                 efficient optimal planning. Arguably, the smallest
                 strategies one can conceive simply prescribe an action
                 for each time step, without considering past decisions
                 or observations. Previous work has shown that finding
                 such optimal strategies even for polytree-shaped
                 diagrams with ternary variables and a single value node
                 is NP-hard, but the case of binary variables was left
                 open. In this paper we address such a case, by first
                 noting that optimal strategies can be obtained in
                 polynomial time for polytree-shaped diagrams with
                 binary variables and a single value node. We then show
                 that the same problem is NP-hard if the diagram has
                 multiple value nodes. These two results close the
                 fixed-parameter complexity analysis of optimal strategy
                 selection in influence diagrams parametrized by the
                 shape of the diagram, the number of value nodes and the

  abstract =     "Many solutions to problems in machine learning and
                 artificial intelligence involve solving a combinatorial
                 optimization problem over discrete variables whose
                 functional dependence is conveniently represented by a
                 graph. This thesis addresses three types of these
                 combinatorial optimization problems, namely, the
                 maximum a posteriori inference in discrete
                 probabilistic graphical models, the selection of
                 optimal strategies for limited memory influence
                 diagrams, and the computation of upper and lower
                 probability bounds in credal networks. These three
                 problems arise out of seemingly very different
                 situations, and one might believe that they share no
                 more than the graph-based specification of their inputs
                 or the underlying probabilistic treatment of
                 uncertainty. However, correspondences among instances
                 of these problems have long been noticed in the
                 literature. For instance, the computation of
                 probability bounds in credal networks can be reduced
                 either to the problem of maximum a posteriori inference
                 in graphical models, or to the selection of optimal
                 strategies in limited memory influence diagrams.
                 Conversely, both the maximum a posteriori inference and
                 the strategy selection problems can be reduced to the
                 computation of a probability bound in a credal network.
                 These reductions suggest that much insight can be
                 gained by carrying out a joint study of the practical
                 and theoretical computational complexity of these three
                 problems. This thesis describes algorithms and
                 complexity results for these three classes of problems.
                 In particular, we develop a new anytime algorithm for
                 the maximum a posteriori problem. Not only the
                 algorithm is of practical relevance, as we show that it
                 compares favorably against a state-of-the-art method,
                 but it is the base of the proof of polynomial-time
                 approximability of the two other problems. We
                 characterize the tractability of the strategy selection
                 problem according to the input parameters, and we show
                 that the strategy selection problem can be solved in
                 polynomial time in singly connected diagrams over
                 binary variables and univariate utility functions, and
                 that relaxing any of these assumptions makes the
                 problem NP-hard to solve or even approximate within any
                 bound. We also investigate the theoretical complexity
                 of computing upper and lower probability bounds in
                 credal networks. We show that the complexity of the
                 problem depends on the irrelevance concept adopted, but
                 is in general NP-hard even in polytree-shaped networks,
                 and even in trees if we assume strong independence. We
                 also show that there is a particular type of inference
                 that can be solved in polynomial time in imprecise
                 hidden Markov models, whether we assume epistemic
                 irrelevance or strong independence.",

                 each model of the ensemble uses a different class as
                 root of the tree. We assume the features to be
                 conditionally independent given the classes, thus
                 generalizing the naive Bayes assumption to the
                 multiclass case. This assumption allows us to optimally
                 identify the correlations between classes and features;
                 such correlations are moreover shared across all models
                 of the ensemble. Inferences are drawn from the ensemble
                 via logarithmic opinion pooling. To minimize Hamming

                 the quality of an indeterminate prediction by a single
                 number is important to fairly compare different models,

                 objective component, and another that is related to the

                 when the measure can be rendered independent of such a

  abstract =     "There is a large number of user reviews on the
                 internet with valuable information on services,
                 products, politics and trends. There is both scientific
                 and economic interest in the automatic understanding of
                 such data. Sentiment classification is concerned with
                 automatic extraction of opinions expressed in user
                 reviews. Unlike standard text categorization tasks that
                 deal with the classification of documents into subjects
                 such as sports, economics and tourism, sentiment
                 classification attempts to tag documents with respect
                 to the feelings they express. Compared to the accuracy
                 of standard methods, sentiment classifiers have shown
                 poor performance. One possible cause of such a poor
                 performance is the lack of adequate representations
                 that lead to opinion discrimination in a concise and
                 machine-readable form. Topic Models are statistical
                 models concerned with the extraction of semantic
                 information hidden in the large number of data
                 available in text collections. They represent a
                 document as a mixture of topics, probability
                 distributions over words that represent a semantic
                 concept. According to Topic Model representation, words
                 can be substituted by topics able to represent
                 concisely its meaning. Indeed, Topic Models perform a
                 data dimensionality reduction that can improve the
                 performance of text classification and information
                 retrieval techniques. In sentiment classification, they
                 can provide the necessary representation by extracting
                 topics that represent the general feelings expressed in
                 text. This work presents a study of the use of Topic
                 Models for representing and classifying user reviews
                 with respect to their feelings. In particular, the
                 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and four
                 extensions (two of them developed by the author) are
                 evaluated on the task of aspect-based sentiment
                 classification. The extensions to the LDA model enables
                 us to investigate the effects of the incorporation of
                 additional information such as context, aspect rating
                 and multiple aspect rating into the original model.",
