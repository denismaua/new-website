 abstract = {There is a large number of user reviews on the
internet with valuable information on services,
products, politics and trends. There is both scientific
and economic interest in the automatic understanding of
such data. Sentiment classification is concerned with
automatic extraction of opinions expressed in user
reviews. Unlike standard text categorization tasks that
deal with the classification of documents into subjects
such as sports, economics and tourism, sentiment
classification attempts to tag documents with respect
to the feelings they express. Compared to the accuracy
of standard methods, sentiment classifiers have shown
poor performance. One possible cause of such a poor
performance is the lack of adequate representations
that lead to opinion discrimination in a concise and
machine-readable form. Topic Models are statistical
models concerned with the extraction of semantic
information hidden in the large number of data
available in text collections. They represent a
document as a mixture of topics, probability
distributions over words that represent a semantic
concept. According to Topic Model representation, words
can be substituted by topics able to represent
concisely its meaning. Indeed, Topic Models perform a
data dimensionality reduction that can improve the
performance of text classification and information
retrieval techniques. In sentiment classification, they
can provide the necessary representation by extracting
topics that represent the general feelings expressed in
text. This work presents a study of the use of Topic
Models for representing and classifying user reviews
with respect to their feelings. In particular, the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and four
extensions (two of them developed by the author) are
evaluated on the task of aspect-based sentiment
classification. The extensions to the LDA model enables
us to investigate the effects of the incorporation of
additional information such as context, aspect rating
and multiple aspect rating into the original model.},
