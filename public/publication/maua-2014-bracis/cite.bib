 abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used models for
sequential data. As with other probabilistic models,
they require the specification of local conditional
probability distributions, which can be too difficult
and error-prone, especially when data are scarce or
costly to acquire. The imprecise HMM (iHMM) generalizes
HMMs by allowing the quantification to be done by sets
of, instead of single, probability distributions. iHMMs
have the ability to suspend judgment when there is not
enough statistical evidence, and can serve as a
sensitivity analysis tool for standard non-stationary
HMMs. In this paper, we formalize iHMMs and develop
efficient inference algorithms to address standard HMM
usage such as the computation of likelihoods and most
probable explanations. Experiments with real data show
that iHMMs produce more reliable inferences without
compromising efficiency.},
