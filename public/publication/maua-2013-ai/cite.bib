 abstract = {Influence diagrams are intuitive and concise
representations of structured decision problems. When
the problem is non-Markovian, an optimal strategy can
be exponentially large in the size of the diagram. We
can avoid the inherent intractability by constraining
the size of admissible strategies, giving rise to
limited memory influence diagrams. A valuable question
is then how small do strategies need to be to enable
efficient optimal planning. Arguably, the smallest
strategies one can conceive simply prescribe an action
for each time step, without considering past decisions
or observations. Previous work has shown that finding
such optimal strategies even for polytree-shaped
diagrams with ternary variables and a single value node
is NP-hard, but the case of binary variables was left
open. In this paper we address such a case, by first
noting that optimal strategies can be obtained in
polynomial time for polytree-shaped diagrams with
binary variables and a single value node. We then show
that the same problem is NP-hard if the diagram has
multiple value nodes. These two results close the
fixed-parameter complexity analysis of optimal strategy
selection in influence diagrams parametrized by the
shape of the diagram, the number of value nodes and the
maximum variable cardinality.},
