 abstract = {This work presents novel algorithms for learning
Bayesian networks of bounded treewidth. Both exact and
approximate methods are developed. The exact method
combines mixed integer linear programming formulations
for structure learning and treewidth computation. The
approximate method consists in sampling k-trees
(maximal graphs of treewidth k), and subsequently
selecting, exactly or approximately, the best structure
whose moral graph is a subgraph of that k-tree. The
approaches are empirically compared to each other and
to state-of-the-art methods on a collection of public
data sets with up to 100 variables.},
