 abstract = {Credal networks relax the precise probability
requirement of Bayesian networks, enabling a richer
representation of uncertainty in the form of closed
convex sets of probability measures. The increase in
expressiveness comes at the expense of higher
computational costs. In this paper, we present a new
variable elimination algorithm for exactly computing
posterior inferences in extensively specified credal
networks, which is empirically shown to outperform a
state-of-the-art algorithm. The algorithm is then
turned into a provably good approximation scheme, that
is, a procedure that for any input is guaranteed to
return a solution not worse than the optimum by a given
factor. Remarkably, we show that when the networks have
bounded treewidth and bounded number of states per
variable the approximation algorithm runs in time
polynomial in the input size and in the inverse of the
error factor, thus being the first known fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme for inference in
credal networks.},
