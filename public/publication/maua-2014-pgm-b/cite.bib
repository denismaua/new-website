 abstract = {Limited memory influence diagrams are graph-based
models that describe decision problems with limited
information, as in the case of teams and agents with
imperfect recall. Solving a (limited memory) influence
diagram is an NP-hard problem, often approached through
local search. In this paper we investigate algorithms
for k-neighborhood local search. We show that finding a
k-neighbor that improves on the current solution is
W[1]-hard and hence unlikely to be polynomial-time
tractable. We then develop fast schema to perform
approximate k-local search; experiments show that our
methods improve on current local search algorithms both
with respect to time and to accuracy.},
