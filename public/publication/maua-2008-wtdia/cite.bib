 abstract = {This paper describes advances in the development of a
trust management system for web-based virtual
communities. We review current research on
computational trust and report on a proposal for trust
management with Markov Logic, a recently developed
probabilistic logic language that aims at unifying
statistical relational procedures. This work addresses
two complex questions: how to learn trust metrics for a
group of interacting agents upon amachine learning
perspective, and how to use pairwise trust metrics
structured as a trust network to compute personalized
trust metrics.},
