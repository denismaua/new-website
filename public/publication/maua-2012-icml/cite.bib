 abstract = {This paper presents a new anytime algorithm for the
marginal MAP problem in graphical models. The algorithm
is described in detail, its complexity and convergence
rate are studied, and relations to previous theoretical
results for the problem are discussed. It is shown that
the algorithm runs in polynomial-time if the underlying
graph of the model has bounded tree-width, and that it
provides guarantees to the lower and upper bounds
obtained within a fixed amount of computational
resources. Experiments with both real and synthetic
generated models highlight its main characteristics and
show that it compares favorably against Park and
Darwiche's systematic search, particularly in the case
of problems with many MAP variables and moderate
tree-width.},
