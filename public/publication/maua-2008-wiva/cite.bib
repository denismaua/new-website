 abstract = {In this paper we analyze the performance of
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in trust
prediction. We use two propositionalization methods
together with the Naive and Tree-Augmented Naive
Bayesian Classifiers, and the C4.5 algorithm. We
compare those results with classifiers defined through
Markov Logic, using data fromthe Epinions.comwebsite, a
well-known product review community. The experiments
show that predicting trust relationships is a difficult
task, in which Markov Logic models outperform other
methods in accuracy but are able to recover only a
relatively small fraction of the existing relationships
in the dataset.},
