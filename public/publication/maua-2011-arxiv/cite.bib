 abstract = {We present a new algorithm for exactly solving
decision making problems represented as influence
diagrams. We do not require the usual assumptions of no
forgetting and regularity; this allows us to solve
problems with simultaneous decisions and limited
information. The algorithm is empirically shown to
outperform a state-of-the-art algorithm on randomly
generated problems of up to 150 variables and $10^64$
solutions. We show that the problem is NP-hard even if
the underlying graph structure of the problem has small
treewidth and the variables take on a bounded number of
states, but that a fully polynomial time approximation
scheme exists for these cases. Moreover, we show that
the bound on the number of states is a necessary
condition for any efficient approximation scheme.},
